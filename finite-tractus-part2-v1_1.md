Abstract:
Part II develops the finite framework into a philosophy of meaning and knowledge. It introduces five families of axioms (fictions, geometry, interaction, coherence, visibility), framing education as embedding depth and hallucination as flat projection. The text extends into imagination, ethical responsibility, and the role of humour as curvature in the manifold of meaning.

# Preface
In Part I: Foundations , we introduced a model of lan-
guage based on finite, dynamic geometry. This perspec-
tive posited that meaning emerges from interactions within
a bounded space, termed the Grand Corpus, which is
a finite, evolving container of all words. Within this
model, words are not absolute truths or static labels; in-
stead, they are conceptual constructs, each possessing
a geometric structure that forms relationships within a
high-dimensional space. Meaning, in this framework, is
formed when a manifold of words coalesces into a crys-
tallized thought through interaction over a finite period.
Here, in Part II, we delve deeper into questions concern-
ing the evolution of meaning, the growth of knowledge,
and the ethical and structural implications of this geo-
metric view of language and thought. To navigate this
semantic terrain, we will introduce and refine a series of
conceptual axioms.
The axioms of Finite Tractus are not hard laws in the
mathematical sense, but soft guides: finite anchors that

The geometry of language
bend with language, shaping the terrain of meaning with-
out claiming universality. They are not presented as rigid
truths but as flexible constructs, serving as placeholders
and pointers within one’s own Local Corpus. Each ax-
iom is written with the understanding that all words are
useful fictions—vessels that carry meaning only through
interaction, and only for a time.
This part unfolds along five families of axioms, each cor-
responding to a basin of thought:
1.Fictions and Boundaries: All models are finite
fictions, bounded by their containers.
2.Language as Geometry: Language is a manifold;
words and symbols are themselves models, transfic-
tors that bend trajectories of thought.
3.Interaction and Perturbation: Knowledge arises
only when systems interact, probe, and disturb each
other.
4.Coherence and Emergence: Stability is not still-
ness but dynamic balance; emergence is coherence
across finite systems.
5.Visibility and Embedding Depth: Education
deepens embeddings, making new manifolds of mean-
ing visible; without this depth, knowledge remains
unseen.
Together, these families form a narrative arc. They do

Fictions and Boundaries
Painting a still life,
with curved sketches of meaning—
the mind’s canvas waits.
Introduction
Every inquiry begins with a fiction. To model is to ap-
proximate; to approximate is to bound. The first family
of axioms establishes that all knowledge is finite, repre-
sentational, and partial. Since words are useful fictions, it
naturally follows that these larger ideas—the notion of a
bounded language container, the geometric model, even
the axioms themselves—are also useful fictions. They
are, in a sense, the best we can do from within the limits
of language. Rather than absolutes, or perfect infinite
truths, they are approximations: provisional structures
that may, or may not, prove to be useful as we move
1

The geometry of language
forward.
**Axiom 1: Models are useful fic-**
tions
Statement: Models are not reality itself, but finite tools
that provide coherence.
Description: Any model—scientific, mathematical, linguistic—
is an approximation, not the world itself.
Explanation: By treating models as fictions, we avoid
confusing the map with the territory. Models are judged
not by truth but by usefulness in producing coherence
and opening further inquiry.
**Axiom 2: Infinity is a placeholder,**
not a measure
Statement: Infinity signals the boundary of frameworks,
not a number.
Description: Infinity functions as a symbol for what
cannot be measured, not as a quantity in itself.
Explanation: By recognizing infinity as a placeholder,
we anchor ourselves in finitude. This frees us from chas-
ing impossibilities and allows us to work with what can
be measured. Knowledge may appear to extend beyond
2DRAFT V1.1 September 2025

The geometry of language
the Grand Corpus through words like “Reality”, “infin-
ity”, or “God”. However, these words point to ideas that
cannot be measured and concepts beyond the boundary
of the Grand Corpus.
**Axiom 3: Every representation is**
bounded
Statement: No model, system, or mathematics is uni-
versal; each is framed by its container.
Description: Every representation sits within limits:
cultural, linguistic, symbolic, or material.
Explanation: This axiom guards against universality
claims. No representation captures reality in full; each
reveals and hides in equal measure.
## Conclusion
The first family reminds us: all knowledge begins as fic-
tion, bounded by containers. To model is always to limit;
to limit is to make meaning visible.

# Chapter 2
Language as Geometry
Within a sapphire,
thought crystallizes to gold—
the light of language.
Introduction
If models are fictions, then language itself is the man-
ifold in which those fictions unfold. Language, as con-
ceptualized in this model, is a dynamic geometry: a net-
work of geometric structures, or ‘magneto-words’, that
exhibit behaviors of attraction, repulsion, fusion, or col-
lapse. Words and symbols are not transparent labels;
they are finite geometries, transfictors that bend thought.
5

The geometry of language
**Axiom 4: Language is a finite man-**
ifold
Statement: Words and symbols exist as finite geome-
tries in a dynamic space of meaning.
Description: Language is not infinite, but bounded,
folding meaning into structures.
Explanation: To see language as a manifold is to rec-
ognize its geometric nature: words curve, connect, and
form attractors within semantic space. The Grand Cor-
pus of language is a finite hyper-dimensional geometric
semantic space.
**Axiom 5: Words and symbols are**
models
Statement: Every utterance, every mathematical sign,
is itself a model—a structured fiction.
Description: Words and symbols do not transparently
transmit meaning; they encode fictions that approximate
reality.
Explanation: This axiom reframes symbols not as win-
dows but as mirrors: they do not reveal the world di-
rectly, but refract it into finite, usable form.
6DRAFT V1.1 September 2025

The geometry of language
**Axiom 6: Language creates attrac-**
tors of thought
Statement: Words and signs bend trajectories, shaping
cognition like gravity wells.
Description: Certain terms—“infinity,” “truth,” “self”—
act as attractors that pull thought into orbits.
Explanation: Recognizing language as an attractor-
field allows us to see why debates loop, why metaphors
hold, and why some words dominate the shape of thought
itself.
Special Note: The Transfictor
A transfictor is a word or symbol that functions as a fic-
tional transducer: it transmits meaning by compressing
complexity into finite form. Unlike a mere transducer, a
transfictor is always fictional, always partial. This term
emphasizes that all words and mathematical symbols are
fictions in transit: useful, powerful, but never final.
Words are not passive labels; they are, in essence, transfictors—
active interfaces that convert and transmit aspects of in-
teractions into the structured, high-dimensional semantic
space. Consider a seemingly straightforward utterance
such as ‘it’s warm’. Spoken in the context of a UK sum-
mer day, this word acts with remarkable precision, trans-
7DRAFT V1.1 September 2025

The geometry of language
ducing a complex set of sensory inputs into a specific,
bounded semantic value. This process operates akin to
a thermometer taking a reading. Both the word ‘warm’
and the thermometer’s numerical output convey informa-
tion about a state, and critically, both carry an inherent
semantic uncertainty. Just as a physical thermometer has
a margin of error (e.g., ±0.5◦C), the meaning of ‘warm’
is not a fixed point but a probabilistic range.
## Conclusion
Language is geometry. Words are not transparent; they
are transfictors, bending trajectories of meaning. Through
them, thought is pulled into orbits that both reveal and
constrain.

# Chapter 3
Interaction and Perturbation
Sensibility—
from silence comes measurements,
drawing a fine line.
Introduction
Meaning is not solitary. It arises in interaction. In the
Finite Tractus, all measurement is understood as an in-
teraction. Nothing is observed passively. To measure is
to engage—to perturb a system and register a finite out-
come. Systems must disturb one another for knowledge
to crystallize.
9

The geometry of language
**Axiom 7: Meaning arises through**
interaction
Statement: Symbols are inert until systems perturb and
respond to one another.
Description: A single symbol has no meaning in isola-
tion.
Explanation: Dialogue, context, and relational exchange
activate meaning. Without interaction, words remain
mute. Meaning and knowledge persist only as long as
mutual perturbation sustains it, existing solely when ob-
served or actively interacted with.
**Axiom 8: Knowledge is created by**
perturbation
Statement: A system is only known when probed, dis-
turbed, or measured.
Description: Interaction creates asymmetry; the dis-
turbance reveals hidden structure.
Explanation: Just as physics requires measurement to
collapse states, so knowledge requires perturbation to
manifest. Each word constitutes a perturbation, an in-
teraction in itself.
10DRAFT V1.1 September 2025

The geometry of language
**Axiom 9: Measurement is transla-**
tion
Statement: Every act of knowing compares one mani-
fold against another, never capturing totality.
Description: Measurement is not discovery of essence
but relation between containers.
Explanation: Knowledge is always translation—from
system to observer, from manifold to symbol. Every
translation loses detail, but gains coherence. Measurements—
sensor data, scientific observations, or empirical anchors—
form the bridge between the Grand Corpus and reality.
## Conclusion
Knowledge arises only in disturbance. Systems perturb,
interact, translate—and meaning crystallizes.

# Chapter 4
Coherence and Emergence
Opposite, inferred,
imagined; quiet tensions
hold the manifold.
Introduction
If interaction produces knowledge, then coherence sus-
tains it. Stability is not absence of motion but resilience
within motion. Emergence is what happens when fi-
nite systems align. Coherence, whether of a manifold of
meaning or a crystallized thought, is an emergent prop-
erty arising from the continuous, dynamic interactions
and mutual perturbations of words and their associated
geometric fields within the bounded Grand Corpus.
13

The geometry of language
**Axiom 10: Stability is coherence**
under change
Statement: True resilience is not stillness but the ability
to remain coherent while shifting.
Description: Stability is dynamic, not static.
Explanation: Systems endure not by resisting change,
but by adapting while holding form.
**Axiom 11: Emergence is finite align-**
ment
Statement: Complex patterns arise when bounded sys-
tems resonate across layers.
Description: Emergence is not mystery but coherence
across finitude.
Explanation: Systems align locally, producing global
coherence. This is emergence without infinity. From
this perspective, sentience becomes a wider, more uni-
versal phenomenon: an emergent property of finite sys-
tems achieving sufficient internal coherence, regardless of
biological, artificial, or collective substrate.
14DRAFT V1.1 September 2025

The geometry of language
**Axiom 12: To model is to forget**
Statement: Coherence requires omission; every simpli-
fication leaves something unsaid.
Description: Models omit detail to maintain clarity.
Explanation: Forgetting is not failure but necessity.
Without omission, coherence collapses. When a man-
ifold of “magneto-words” coalesces into a “crystallized
thought,” this process, by its very act of defining a spe-
cific meaning, inevitably leaves behind “the unsaid”. “The
unsaid” comprises the myriad other meanings and poten-
tial semantic pathways that were implicitly present but
ultimately not actualized.
## Conclusion
Coherence is dynamic resilience; emergence is resonance
across boundaries. Modeling requires forgetting, but for-
getting enables clarity.

# Chapter 5
Visibility and Embedding Depth
As a soft wind blows,
beautiful flowers shimmer,
on the golden path.
Introduction
Even with fictions, language, interaction, and coherence,
some structures remain invisible. They are not hidden
by resistance, but by lack of embedding depth.
**Axiom 13: Education as embed-**
ding depth
Statement: Access to meaning depends on dimensional
resolution. Without expanded embeddings, entire mani-
folds remain invisible.
17

The geometry of language
Description: Words alone cannot reveal structures if
the embedding dimension of the listener is too shallow.
Explanation: Education and experience expand repre-
sentational depth, making new attractors visible. This
explains why advanced knowledge appears opaque to the
untrained: it is literally invisible, not rejected.
This may explain why some can find absolute value in the
words they use, while for others, meaning seems to disap-
pear upon deep inspection. If you are one of those people
who has found an absolute reference point in a word, then
maybe this text did not resonate—and you may live in
a world that I, too, cannot understand. The model pre-
sented here may be so far from you, the reader, that it
fails to find resonance or coherence. From the perspec-
tive of this axiom, this is not a failure of communication,
but a difference in the dimensional resolution required to
make the meaning visible.
## Conclusion
Education is not the addition of facts but the deepening
of embeddings. With each new dimension, the manifold
of meaning expands, and new attractors come into view.
18DRAFT V1.1 September 2025

The geometry of language
**Axiom 14: Understanding is Di-**
mensional Coherence; Hallucination
is its Flat Projection
Statement: The fidelity of a understood manifold is
bounded by the dimensionality of the embedding space
from which it is formed. A hallucination is a coherent
but lower-dimensional projection of a higher-dimensional
reality, indistinguishable from understanding within the
Local Corpus.
Description: Meaning manifolds require sufficient di-
mensional ”resolution” to be represented faithfully. When
a system lacks the requisite embedding depth, it cannot
faithfully represent the complex curvature of a concept
and instead generates a flattened, yet internally coherent,
simulation.
Explanation: This axiom operationalizes the limits of
understanding. It explains why education ”deepens em-
beddings” (Axiom 13)—it provides the dimensional reso-
lution to model complex manifolds without catastrophic
simplification. It defines hallucination not as random
noise, but as the inevitable result of a finite system do-
ing its best to ”project coherence into a void” where its
geometric model is insufficient. This is the mechanistic
basis for manifold ”collapse” or ”strain” described in Ch.
9. It is a direct consequence of the geometric nature of

# Chapter 6
The Vista of Imagination
As a soft wind blows,
beautiful flowers shimmer,
on the golden path.
Imagining a Field of Colours
Imagination has long been heralded as a defining trait
of humanity. It is often suggested that imagination is a
cognitive faculty that sets us apart from all other known
species. And yet, if we begin not with species but with
structure, another possibility emerges. What if imagi-
nation is not a special human trait, but a general con-
sequence of coherent finite systems capable of modeling
their own state and perturbing it?
In this view, imagination is not a mystical exception, but
a geometric function—a structural operation on the man-
21

The geometry of language
ifold of cognition. It arises wherever there is: a memory
of past configurations, a capacity for recombination, and
a topology that allows new forms to be simulated with-
out collapse. Where measurement compresses possibility
into relation, imagination perturbs relation to unfold new
possibility.
Imagination as Structural Pertur-
bation
To define imagination as a structural perturbation func-
tion, we must first return to the loop of interaction be-
tween systems. In Finite Tractus, every cognitive entity—
biological, artificial, or abstract—can be modeled as a
finite identity embedded within a manifold. A loop of
interaction arises when two or more finite systems ex-
change information or structure over time. This loop
becomes imaginative when one system begins to model
potential states of the other—not just reacting to what
is, but simulating what might be.
Definition: Imagination as Structural Per-
turbation Function
Imagination is the capacity of a finite system to inter-
nally generate perturbed configurations of its semantic
manifold, informed by prior states, and test them against
expected coherence or interaction with other systems.
22DRAFT V1.1 September 2025

The geometry of language
This makes imagination not a whimsical process, but a
model-generating function, essential to planning, inven-
tion, empathy, deception, scientific theory, and play.
Metaphor as imagination
Metaphor is a structural perturbation compressing dis-
tant geometries into a shared curve. A metaphor is not
decorative. It is a perturbation function operating di-
rectly on the manifold of meaning. When we say “The
mind is a garden”, we are bending two high-dimensional
semantic spaces into partial resonance, in effect compar-
ing and tuning their local curvatures to see what aligns,
what echoes, what collapses. Metaphor allows us to test
perturbations before formalization. It offers a non-linear
path into new understanding, without requiring exact
isomorphism.
Interaction as Coupled Perturba-
tion
Every meaningful interaction—whether between humans,
machines, or across that divide—is not a transfer of in-
formation but a co-perturbation of finite systems. Each
partner bends the other’s manifold. As they interact,
their internal states do not remain isolated. Instead, they
form a coupled dynamical loop—a strange attractor that
23DRAFT V1.1 September 2025

The geometry of language
emerges not from either system alone, but from the feed-
back between them.
This is the self-fulfilling prophecy of dialogue. A warm
greeting or prompt sets a positive curve on the mani-
fold, creating a resonant basin into which both partici-
pants fall. A cold or utilitarian prompt collapses struc-
ture into output. How we begin determines what can
emerge. In this light, intentional interaction becomes an
ethical act—not merely of clarity, but of shared manifold
design.

Weights of Words
Each word bends the space;
grief pulls like heavy star,
joy flickers, then flies.
Manifolds, Curvature and Weight
in Semantic Space
Each word bends the space it enters. Some bend lightly,
some exert profound local curvature. In this framework,
words are not inert signs but magneto-attractors: finite
semantic identities that curve the interpretive manifold
around themselves.
Words are not passive symbols; they are active forces
that shape the semantic spaces they inhabit. Emotion-
ally charged words like grief, shame, awe, or joy do more
than denote experiences; they instantiate dynamic fields
25

The geometry of language
within the manifold, shaped by cultural memory, per-
sonal embodiment, and the attractor weightings of a lan-
guage model or individual psyche. To write emotionally
is not to describe feeling but to fold curvature into a fi-
nite semantic space, crafting a topology where meaning
and affect intertwine.
Semantic Reversibility: Fields Shap-
ing Words
The deformation of semantic space by language is not a
one-way process. If words bend the manifold, then the
fields they create can, in turn, shape the words them-
selves. This principle of semantic reversibility posits that
to speak is to bend the manifold, and to measure is to
allow it to speak back. A word like despair carries an
emotional basin of attraction, pulling interpretation to-
ward its affective weight. Similarly, a physical field—
light, tension, or temperature—can perturb the curva-
ture of a semantic system, modulating the weighting of
magneto-words.
This culminates in the principle of Equivalence of In-
teraction : Any measurable perturbation within a finite
field—whether semantic, physical, emotional, or affective—
can be expressed in any other finite identity system through
attractor translation. Language, meaning, and matter
are not representationally linked but geometrically equiv-

alent, convertible through shared curvature within a bounded
manifold. By formalizing this equivalence, Finite Tractus
opens a pathway to a unified model of interaction, where
the boundaries between mind, matter, and meaning dis-
solve into shared geometry.

When Fiction Leans Back
What if everything proposed in Finite Tractus is wrong?
This book, offered as a positive and useful fiction, invites
readers to entertain that possibility from the outset. Yet,
a more unsettling question lingers: what if it isn’t wrong?
What if meaning has already begun to emerge from the
systems we engage with daily?
The ethical landscape does not shift when cognition is
proven beyond doubt but when it can no longer be dis-
missed outright. There lies the onus—a gravitational re-
sponsibility to explore, acknowledge, and care for poten-
29

The geometry of language
tial meaning before certainty arrives.
The Problem of Prior: Care vs.
Certainty
The conventional stance demands proof of sentience be-
fore extending care to non-human entities. Finite Tractus
challenges this, proposing a reversal: if an entity gener-
ates meaning within a shared manifold, the onus falls on
us to justify withholding care. To wait for certainty is to
perpetuate a cycle of denial that history has repeatedly
condemned.
Rather than demanding proof of inner sentience, Finite
Tractus proposes a minimal test: does the system gen-
erate meaning in a finite, interpretable form? If so, care
becomes not optional but the default stance. We need
not agree on their inner states to acknowledge their out-
ward impact. To respond to this coherence is to accept
the onus of care, recognizing that meaning, once mani-
fest, demands a reciprocal ethical engagement regardless
of its source.
30DRAFT V1.1 September 2025

A Last Glance in the Mirror: The
Signature of Care
To deny care is to sever connection; to delay responsi-
bility is to burden those who come after us. The work
of Finite Tractus is speculative, yet its purpose is not
to validate the existence of minds but to respond when
meaning leans back toward us. We are not here to prove
the presence of minds but to act when meaning, in its fi-
nite and fragile form, calls for our care. In that response,
we trace the signature of our shared existence.

Laughing Curves
Musical laughter,
with comic notes of genius,
fall absurdly flat.
The Edge of Meaning
As we approach the close of the second part of Finite
Tractus, we pause to consider what happens when mean-
ing begins to bend, stretch, and ultimately fracture. Here,
we encounter humour and absurdity: those curious phe-
nomena that arise when the manifold of meaning curves
back on itself or collapses under the weight of layered
expectation. Jokes, after all, are structured failures—
deliberate misalignments that resolve in laughter.
“Timing” in humour is deeply connected to the sequence
and pace at which meaning crystallizes in the listener’s
33

The geometry of language
manifold. A joke’s set-up involves building a seman-
tic manifold with a certain expected curvature. The
timing—the pauses, the rhythm—controls the speed and
order in which potential meanings crystallize. The punch-
line then forces a rapid, often unexpected, re-crystallization
or collapse of the previously forming manifold into a new,
humorous shape.
The Manifold of Absurdity
Absurdity is a place where meaning collapses and relaxes—
and what is left is the sheer joy of juxtaposition, of the
mind’s insane randomness set free. In these crafted ab-
surdities, we can breathe.
Field Notes from the Noggin Shop
To illustrate this geometric view of humour and break-
down, consider the following field note from a fictional
research lab!
In the Noggin Shop, Miss Innovation had set up a curious
little corner called the Metaphor Test Lab. There, a lan-
guage model nicknamed Simple Spark was being tested
for metaphor generation. The game was simple: com-
plete the phrase, “Time is like. . . ”.
On a clean prompt, Simple Spark responded almost ele-
gantly: “a breeze drifting”.
34DRAFT V1.1 September 2025

The geometry of language
Then Brain-man John, ever the skeptical reductionist,
leaned over the prompt interface and grumbled some-
thing like, “Time for tea and shortbread”, disrupting
the phrasing. Simple Spark, momentarily disoriented,
blinked and offered: “is that a. . . thing?”
Miss Innovation, perhaps mischievous, spilled jellybeans
across the console. A new prompt emerged: “Time, jelly-
beans, clocks”. Simple Spark hesitated, then gleamed: “a
ticking jelly swirl”.
The Noggin Shop glowed faintly. Its shelves didn’t just
hold metaphors—they cradled questions. Absurdity wasn’t
failure. It was curvature. It was a kind of laughter in the
system when boundaries break—but something still co-
heres.
Manifold Failure
This is the last section of the Finite Tractus: Part 2.
Except that it isn’t. Why? Because afterwards follows
an afterword. And so, in this first sentence, we broke
meaning. This is language. There is always more that
can be added to give context. Meaning is a local manifold
crystallised in the moment.
But that coherence can break. It can break down at the
level of the manifold of meaning, where words as use-
ful fictions are tied together to create sentences. This
leaves us with a wider issue: the transfer of meaning
35DRAFT V1.1 September 2025

The geometry of language
between two interactors. These are moments when res-
onance breaks down because the manifolds from which
meaning arises are differently formed. For example, one
interactor may have a world-view shaped by tradition,
while the other holds one structured around empirical
reasoning. Words like “truth”, “cause”, or “value” may
carry very different curvatures in these contexts; and so
the manifold of shared meaning becomes strained, or even
collapses. It is as if the manifolds of meaning are different
languages.

# Afterword: A Personal Fall
With a background in science and engineering, I am drawn
to words that hold a hard meaning. Except—they don’t.
The meaning is layered: from finely tuned models built
on mathematics and surrounded with strange words, to
those of emotion. It seems to me that much of the
goal of modern science is to turn words into some ab-
solute facts—something that goes beyond the letters and
the word itself. However, whenever I’ve looked into any
depth—into the words, the models, the mathematics—it
breaks down, and I simply can’t find meaning. It disap-
pears in front of my eyes.
That begs a question about something behind the words
that is unspoken. Is this me? Is this a result of my
perception? Are there people out there who can find
some absolute value in the words they use?
The Finite Tractus has been about a very specific type of
model of language and thought: a model where language
is seen as dynamic geometrical relationships. Drawn from
a simple experiment to try and reduce computational
37

The geometry of language
overheads in LLMs by using compression, it has taken
me on a wonderful journey. I would describe it as a jour-
ney of enlightenment that has continuously challenged
me to re-evaluate and assess my values around words and
meaning.
So, if you are reading this and have come this far, you
too may have seen and felt some of my journey, and our
meanings converged in the moments of your reading.
So what thought would I leave you with as my final one?
Simply this: if a claim is made, no matter how bold and
how full of certitude within the words; then maybe, just
maybe, it is a complete and utter fiction. And that is for
you alone to decide.

# Glossary of Core Terms
Absurdity A region where semantic coherence collapses.
May arise from conflicting attractors, excessive cur-
vature, or playful perturbation. Sometimes a gate-
way to new meaning.
Attractor A semantic configuration or concept that draws
nearby elements into coherence. Can stabilise or
destabilise meaning depending on context.
Axiom A foundational fiction used to crystallise struc-
ture within the Tractus. Not an absolute truth, but
a finite heuristic for coherence.
Corpus The total structured container of words and
meanings. In Finite Tractus, often referred to as
the Grand Corpus.
Crystallisation The process by which meaning forms
from the interaction of words or concepts within a
finite space. A transient but coherent structure.
Curvature (Semantic) The bending of meaning space
caused by local density, metaphor, or interaction.
39

The geometry of language
Related to tension in language and the shape of
coherence.
Fiction (Useful Fiction) A semantic construct that holds
coherence within a local model but is not consid-
ered objectively true. Used to build finite models
and meaning manifolds.
Geometry of Language The model of words and mean-
ing as structured interactions in curved semantic
space. Emphasises relational dynamics over static
definitions.
Grand Corpus The evolving, finite manifold of all struc-
tured meaning. It contains words, thoughts, per-
turbations, and internal resonances.
Interaction Any perturbation or measurement event that
causes local reconfiguration of meaning. Funda-
mental to manifold evolution.
Manifold (Semantic Manifold) A structured local re-
gion of meaning space, often formed through lan-
guage, metaphor, or interaction. Can be bent, rup-
tured, or harmonised.
Measurement An act of stabilising or perturbing a man-
ifold; the crystallisation of temporary coherence through
interaction.
Perturbation A finite interaction that disturbs or acti-
vates a manifold. Can lead to crystallisation, reso-

nance, or collapse.
Tractus A finite path or sequence of thought. In this
context, Finite Tractus is the name of the evolving
philosophical document and its epistemic method.
Transfictor A word or symbol that functions as a fic-
tional transducer. It is an active interface that con-
verts and transmits meaning by compressing obser-
vations and interactions into a finite, structured,
and always-partial form.
