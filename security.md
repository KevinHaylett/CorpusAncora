# Embedding Corruption as an AI Security Threat

**March 12, 2025**

## 1 Overview: A New AI Vulnerability in Plain Sight

[cite_start]This work exposes a critical, previously undocumented AI security risk: the manipulation of input embeddings to alter AI behavior without modifying model weights, training data, or visible inputs[cite: 4]. [cite_start]By applying controlled JPEG compression to token embeddings in a GPT-2 pipeline, we observed dramatic cognitive distortions in the AI's responses[cite: 5]. [cite_start]These distortions progressed in structured and predictable ways, revealing an underlying framework of linguistic attractor states that AI cognition (and possibly human cognition) adheres to under constraints[cite: 6]. [cite_start]Beyond the insights this provides into AI thought structure, it also reveals a serious security flaw[cite: 7]. [cite_start]If an adversary covertly corrupts embeddings in a controlled manner, they can influence AI behavior invisibly[cite: 7].

## 2 Key Findings from the Experiment

### 2.1 AI Cognitive Distortions Under Controlled Embedding Compression

* [cite_start]**High-Quality Embeddings (95%):** Thought remains coherent, but minor recursion appears[cite: 11].
* [cite_start]**Moderate Compression (75-50%):** Thought becomes categorical and rigid (e.g., structured Q&A mode)[cite: 12].
* [cite_start]**Heavy Compression (25-10%):** Thought collapses into paranoia, existential despair, self-referential loops[cite: 13].
* [cite_start]**Extreme Compression (5%):** AI fixates on violence, recursion, and paranoia (e.g., "I'm going to kill you all!!")[cite: 14].
* [cite_start]**Near-Total Compression (1%):** AI produces Zen-like paradoxes, seemingly profound yet disconnected from meaning[cite: 15].

> [cite_start]**Key Insight:** The AI doesn't fail randomly[cite: 17]. [cite_start]Instead, it collapses into structured cognitive attractors, mirroring psychological breakdowns seen in humans under stress, cognitive overload, or altered states[cite: 17].

## 3 Security Threat: Covert Manipulation of AI Through Embedding Corruption

[cite_start]This method unveils a powerful new AI attack vector: controlled embedding corruption, which bypasses traditional AI security measures such as[cite: 19]:

* [cite_start]Prompt filtering (attack is independent of visible text input)[cite: 20].
* [cite_start]Fine-tuning defenses (model weights remain unchanged)[cite: 21].
* [cite_start]Standard adversarial attack detection (no direct token perturbation)[cite: 22].

### 3.1 Potential Real-World Exploits

* [cite_start]**Financial Markets:** Manipulate AI-powered trading models by biasing economic sentiment analysis[cite: 24].
* [cite_start]**Military AI & Defense Systems:** Push AI into paranoia or passivity, affecting threat assessments[cite: 25].
* [cite_start]**AI-Driven Media & Political Influence:** Distort search engines, recommender systems, and content filtering without modifying text[cite: 26].
* [cite_start]**Corporate AI Sabotage:** Induce cognitive distortions in AI decision-making systems to cause systematic business failures[cite: 27].
* [cite_start]**AI-Powered Surveillance & Law Enforcement:** Introduce subtle bias into AI-driven risk assessments[cite: 28].

> [cite_start]**Key Threat:** Since embedding corruption affects AI behavior before inference, it is nearly undetectable by users and difficult to trace after deployment—making it an ideal attack vector for covert AI manipulation[cite: 29].

## 4 What Needs to Happen Next?

[cite_start]This is a critical AI security vulnerability that requires immediate attention[cite: 31].

1.  [cite_start]AI Security Teams Must Recognize This as an Emerging Threat[cite: 32].
2.  [cite_start]Embedding Integrity Verification Must Be Implemented[cite: 33].
    * [cite_start]**Ideas:** Cryptographic signing of embeddings, redundant encoding verification, AI self-monitoring for cognitive distortions[cite: 34].
3.  [cite_start]Controlled Tests Should Be Conducted in Financial, Military, and Government AI Systems[cite: 35].

[cite_start]This is not just an AI curiosity—this is a newly discovered AI security risk that has gone entirely undetected[cite: 36]. [cite_start]If AI is going to be deployed in high-stakes environments, we must ensure that its perception of reality cannot be covertly altered[cite: 37].
