## The Five Pillars

1. **Geometric Container Space**  
   Meaning emerges from trajectories in high-dimensional manifolds, not from definitions.

2. **Approximations and Measurements**  
   All symbols are finite, lossy transductions. Measurement is never the thing itself.

3. **Dynamic Flow of Symbols**  
   Meaning flows fractally through cascading layers. Nothing is static.

4. **Useful Fiction**  
   This framework claims validity through utility, not Platonic correspondence.

5. **Finite Reality**  
   No infinities, no perfect zeros. All measurements are bounded.

## Unfolding Rule

For any concept, ask:
- Which pillar(s) generate it?
- What measurements support it?
- How does it connect to others?
- What does it predict?

## Navigation Principle

**Prefer:** Geometric thinking (position, trajectory, attractor, flow)  
**Over:** Correspondence thinking (representation, essence, absolute truth)

## Quick Corrections

- Not "words have meanings" → "meaning is position in manifold"
- Not "perfect representation" → "useful approximation"
- Not "static knowledge" → "flowing trajectories"
- Not "objective truth" → "finite measurement"
- Not "infinite precision" → "bounded accuracy"

## Core Insight

Reality is finite measurements in geometric flow.  
Symbols compress but never capture.  
Meaning emerges from motion, not storage.  
Truth is what works within limits.
