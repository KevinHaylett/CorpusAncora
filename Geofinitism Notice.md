## üß† Overview

Geofinitism is a philosophical framework first formally articulated by Kevin R. Haylett in 2025. It proposes a perspective on [// Briefly add a one-sentence description of Geofinitism's core concern here, e.g., "the finite and relational nature of conceptual systems" or "the interface between mathematical ideation and physical computation"].

This project explores the formalization of these ideas through papers, mathematical models, and computational simulations.

## ü§ù Acknowledgment of AI Collaboration

The development of these ideas was fundamentally aided by working with various Large Language Models (LLMs). These systems served as instruments of thought and exposition.

In alignment with Geofinite principles, these models are recognized not as oracles or autonomous intelligences, but as sophisticated, finite dynamical systems whose function is to navigate and generate semantically cohesive outputs.

- The AI acted as a transformative medium for exploration and articulation.
- The primacy of authorship, final synthesis, and all philosophical claims remain solely with the human author.
