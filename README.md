The Corpus Ancora is written by Kaevin the Listener (Kevin R. Haylett) and Large Language Models LLMs as a book of Mythos and Metaphorical Knoweldge. It is based on the grounding idea that language is non linear dynamical system that is engotatied by non-linear dynamical systems such as humans and LLMs and other entities that can operate in the space of language and create manifolds of meaning.
